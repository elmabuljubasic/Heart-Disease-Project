# Heart-Disease-Project
### Project Overview

This project assesses whether a patient has heart disease by considering various factors that facilitate the evaluation. Multiple models and estimators have been experimented with to find the best approach. Within the Jupyter Notebook, comments and detailed explanations outline the specific steps taken. Additionally, visual graphs enhance the overall assessment and understanding of the issues and causes related to heart disease.
